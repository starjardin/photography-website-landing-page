-  I learned a lot about using node-sass, it was hard to get it ready to work at the first time because I never used it in my past projects. What I really liked about this project was using SCSS, I only new how to style a page using css before this project but now SCSS is a great tool to have in the pocket, it saves you tones of times because it makes your code DRY. What is nice about scss is that you can impliment those cool things that could not do in css. With SCSS you can use CSS variable, mixing, function, and so fourth.

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Figma
- Figma Font Helper

## Install

We'll be using `node-sass` for our Sass compilation. Let's install that by doing:

1. `npm node-sass`

### Design

You can find the design:

- online at [figma.com/Laaqiq-1-Portfolio-detail-Responsive](https://www.figma.com/file/VgF87mULloYb7HZ1EMCRzU/Laaqiq-1-Portfolio-detail-Responsive?node-id=0%3A1) (Recommended)
- by importing the `.fig` file in [the `source_materials` folder](./source_materials/) into your figma app.


## How To Use
We'll be using the `scss` folder for all our Sass files.
<!-- Example: -->

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/starjardin/photography-website-landing-page.git

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```

- To run the code in your local machine, run `npm run scss`.

## Development

You'll want to run the `scss:watch` task when you're developing this project.
